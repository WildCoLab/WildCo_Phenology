examples of how to extract phenology from CT images

There are 3 scripts for extracting phenology/productivity data from CT timelapse images: one draws the region of inference; a second extracts the vegetation indices; a third fits curves to extract the phenological dates. The output of each script is put into separate folders.

Timelapse images may be ordered in one of 2 ways: CT site as a folder with subfolders for each deployment period; deployment period as a folder with subfolders for each CT site. This will simply depend on how your field work was conducted.
